#### Royan Twin Congress Server

* Requirements
  * [Python 3](https://www.python.org/)
  * [Django 1.11](https://www.djangoproject.com/)

###### I used `Nginx` and `Gunicorn` to host the website on a
`ubuntu server 16.04` and `Let's Encrypt` to secure the connection and
`Postgres` as database backend. For more information on deployment
details visit [DigitalOcean guidance](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-django-with-postgres-nginx-and-gunicorn-on-ubuntu-16-04)

This backend code is developed for [Royan Institute](http://www.royaninstitute.org/)
to help them better hosting [International Royan Twin Congress](http://www.royancongress.com/)

Android code is available in my other [repository](https://github.com/szamani20/Royan-Twin-Congress-Android).
